            I'm the only person in the world with my name.Thank you for using my words in your work. A tagline for an
            airline: Take the High Road. If you work for an ad agency and getting paid for it aren't you the one who is
            being influenced by advertising?. Cemeteries are just garbage dumps filled with humans. Rumour has it
            targeted online advertising was developed because the internet was upset that you could read it but it
            couldn't read you. Trepidelicious.</p-->
